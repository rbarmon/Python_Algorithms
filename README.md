# Python_Algorithms
This is a compilation of Python algorithm implementations designed to address a case study situation using strategies and algorithmic paradigms learned during a course.

These implementations adhere to specific time and space complexity constraints and have been thoroughly tested to solve the problem with edge cases in mind. The key algorithms and strategies employed include Dijkstra's Algorithm, DP Strategies, Edmonds Karp Algorithm, and Suffix Trie.

How to Run (One way to do it):
- Download Folder
- Navigate to respective python files 
- Add if __name__ == '__main__': to the bottom of the file
- Add cases to test and call functions
